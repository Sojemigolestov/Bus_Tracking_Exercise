# Bus Tracking Exercise


# Project description

Real-world data powered bus tracker that uses MapBox's API to gather and render actual map data accurately. This project features real-time information on bus stops as well as precise location tracking with custom map markers for a predetermined bus route between two specific locations.

# How to run

To run this project simple clone the repository and either double-click the index.html file or drag it onto your browser. For this project to work properly you'll need an API key to use MapBox's services, you can obtain yours here <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/get-started-tokens-api/">MAP BOX TOKEN</a>. Once you have your token ready, paste it on the mapanimation.js file and you're set! As always, make sure to keep all the filetree within the same directory, otherwise the program will not work.

# Roadmap of future improvements

In future iterations of this project I'll add different bus routes as well as an input box for the user to determine start and end points for the desired bus route and bus tracking endeavours. I'll also include tooltips for the bus station markers with pictures for better reference and orientation.
